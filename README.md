**Branches** are copies of all files in your primary branch ("master" by default). They are created when someone wants to make a change to a file in the repository then it creates a new branch that is identical to the primary at the time that it is created. This also creates a **pull request** (a request for a user to "pull" and merge your code - the branch - with the master).
